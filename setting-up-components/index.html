<h1>Setting Up Components</h1> 

<p>Almost every project can be broken down into smaller, logical areas. These 'building blocks' of a project are termed Components in Gemini. A key feature of Components in Gemini is the ability to nest them in a hierarchical fashion. Thus you can create Components like:</p>

<p><img src="list_of_components.png" /></p>

<p>Projects may utilise Gemini's inbuilt breakdown of Components (often known as Area). You may choose not to use this field or to create your own Custom Field to breakdown work.</p>

<p>To create Components/Areas, select Project Settings from the menu. You will then see the Components/Area tab.</p>
<p>Select the project you wish to maintain Component/Area data for and you can add and organise this standard work breakdown structure.</p>

<p>Below is a sample component list for a project. Note how it has been organised into parent/child levels.</p>

<p>Add components as required.</p>
