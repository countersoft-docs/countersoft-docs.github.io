<h1>Managing Custom Reports</h1>
You can develop your own <a href="/creating-your-own-reports">custom reports</a> using Excel and execute them from the <a href="/concept-items-grid">Grid</a>. In order to locate your reports they must be placed in the reports folder on the web server, which resides under App_Data. Because the directory of reports is loaded when the application starts if you create a new report you will need to execute an IISRESET or recycle the Application Pool in order to force the application to reload the list.</p>
