<h1>Upgrades FAQ</h1> 

<h3>What is the latest version, can I upgrade to it, and do I have to pay for upgrades?</h3>
<p>The latest version of Gemini is always shown on the <a href="https://docs.countersoft.com/upgrading/">Upgrade Documentation page</a>. You can upgrade for FREE if you have an in-date Support & Maintenance Agreement, which is enforced through the expiry date of your Gemini license, or you are a hosted customer on Gemini 6 or Gemini 7. On-premise customers can download the latest version of Gemini from our docs site (follow the Upgrade links), or our dotcom. Hosted customers need to email <a href="mailto:Support@Countersoft.com">Support@Countersoft.com</a> and request an upgrade.</p>

<h3>I am a hosted customer, does my site get upgraded automatically?</h3>
<p>No. Customers have found it too disruptive when the UI or functionality changes without notice, and we do not have the bandwidth to manually schedule upgrades for all the hosted sites in our environment. We upgrade hosted customers if they request an upgrade to take advantage of new features/bugfixes, or if technology and/or security necessitate it.</p>

<h3>What versions of Gemini do Countersoft support?</h3>
<p>Officially we only support versions 6 and 7 because earlier versions rely on unsupported layered products. However, we provide all the technical assistance we can to customers who are on earlier version of Gemini if they have a valid Support and Maintenance Agreement with us.</p>

<h3>Can I skip releases when I upgrade?</h3>
<p>Yes. When you download a new release it contains all the SQL scripts and code it needs to incrementally update your database. When you start Gemini following an upgrade, it compares the version of the database with the version of the web application and incrementally executes all upgrades in-between.</p>

<h3>How do I know what features/changes have been made between my current release and the latest?</h3>
<p>Look at the <a href="https://www.countersoft.com/news/">Product News</a> page on the dotcom, which contains the highlights and also a link to the Change Log where a more detailed list of changes is to be found.</p>

<h3>Why is Gemini 7.3 not highlighted on the Product News page?</h3>
<p>Gemini 7.3 is a patch release to Gemini 7.2, compiled against later versions of Microsoft's Client Identity Library. It has no feature changes from 7.2 so it would be misleading or confusing to put up a page about it.</p>

<h3>Can I use my production license for a test environment?</h3>
<p>Yes. One production license can be used in 3 instances - 1 x Production, 1 x UAT, and 1 x Development.</p>
