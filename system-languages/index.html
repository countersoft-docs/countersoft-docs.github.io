<p>To activate a language, click on the Active column and the inline editing will appear. 
Check the box and it will be activated. The newly activated language will be assigned an 
initial template based on its language and culture code. For example, if you activated Canadian French,
the initial starter file would use the French-France version as it is the closest match. Based on the FR language.
If there is no language available, you will get the default based on the US english.</p>
