title: Setting Up Versions

<h1>Setting Up Versions</h1> 

<p>Versions are manageable phases that encapsulate work to be done. Once the sprint is complete a working product is expected to be delivered. The objective is to define sprints that contain the work to be completed. A sprint that contains work to be completed is known as a Version Backlog.</p>

<p>Items in the Version Backlog are scheduled - resource and delivery dates have been allocated.</p>

<p>Every project enables the creation of Versions (sometimes known as Versions).</p>

<p>Versions can be organized into a hierarchical structure (nested):</p>

<p>Add sprints as required.</p>

<p>Every sprint should be allocated a start and completion date.</p>

<p>These dates help you plot Burn-down Charts.</p>
