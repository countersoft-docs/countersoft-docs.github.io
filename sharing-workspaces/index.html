<h1>Sharing Workspaces</h1> 

<p>Workspaces can be shared with anyone in a User Group that has a "Can Share With" connection to a User Group you are in.</p>

<p>Once User Groups are connected, the option to share a Workspace with another User Group, or with a User from another User Group, will appear on the Share tab.</p>

<h2>Lock & Sync</h2>
<p>Every workspace is defined by the filter at the top of the view.</p>
<p><img src="filter.png" /></p>
<p>If a workspace is shared with Lock and Sync co-workers you share the Workspace with, cannot permanently change the filter criteria you have set, or indeed the structure of the Workspace - columns, column order etc. This ensures everyone sees what you want them to see.</p>

<h2>Allow members to sequence items</h2>
<p>Tick this option to allow users your Workspace is shared with to change the sequence of items in the Sequence Zone.</p>

<h2>Co-workers</h2>
<p>Select which user groups you want to share with. You can only share with groups or users that are in your <a href="/interaction-groups">Interaction Groups</a>.</p>
