<h1>DocStore</h1>
<p>The DocStore app allows you to manage and organize not only documents, but all file types that you wish to upload into Gemini. The DocStore is personalized for specific workspaces, allowing for privacy and organization from workspace to workspace. Within the DocStore, you may add, edit, and remove folders to fit your organizational needs.</p>
