<h1>Roadmap - Future Overview</h1> 

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Roadmap app displays the future of your project, or Sprint/Version, that is currently being planned for release. Roadmap helps you understand when, and how far, a release is from being deployed. A percentage metric helps you to understand quickly how much progress is left for completion.</p>

<p>The selection of various Sprints/Versions helps you to drill down directly into all assets of your project progress.</p>

<p>To also ensure that a project or version is being maintained and progressively worked on, the Roadmap app displays time information to better gauge how much time has been applied, and is left, towards a project or version release.</p>

Note: in order for a Sprint/Version to appear in the Roadmap, it must not be archived, and not released.

<h2>Permission Settings</h2>
<p>With Gemini 6.1, configuring permissions for individual apps, and access to specific projects and user groups, has never been easier.</p>

</p>Simply navigate to the Apps section of your Gemini system, located at <b>Customize > Apps</b>. From here, select the Roadmap app. You will then be able to configure the pertinent projects and user groups that require Roadmap access.
