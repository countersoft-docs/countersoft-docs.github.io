<h1>Setting Up Sprints</h1> 

<p>Sprints (or Versions) represent time-boxed work to be done. Once the sprint is complete, working code is expected to be delivered.</p>
<p>The objective is to define Sprints that contain the work to be completed. Work that needs to be completed but is not yet assigned to a Sprint is known as the Backlog.</p>

<p>Items in the Backlog are assigned to Sprints, and scheduled in the process. Resources are assigned and delivery dates are determined.</p>

<p>Any project can use Gemini's Sprint time-boxing, not just Agile projects.</p>

<p>Like Components, Sprints can be organized into a hierarchical structure (nested):</p>

<p>Every sprint should be allocated a start and completion date. This is very important if you wish to use Gemini's Progress page with its Burndown and Burnup charts.</p>
