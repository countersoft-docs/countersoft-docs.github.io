<h1>Managing Agile and Scrum</h1> 

<p>Adopting an agile and Scrum way of working means following the Agile Software Development manifesto. Agile places emphasis on iterative development, people interactions and responding to change.</p>
<p>Scrum is an agile framework for completing software development or any other kind of project.</p>

<p> <a href="http://pinterest.com/countersoft/agile-scrum-infographics/">Visual infographics</a> provide a great way to understand Agile and Scrum.</p>

<h2>Product Backlog</h2>
<p>There is usualy a list of things that you have to deliver over time. This list of things to be delivered is known as a Product Backlog.</p>
<p>Items in the Product Backlog are un-scheduled - no resource or delivery dates are allocated.</p>

<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>
<p>Sprints are manageable phases that encapsulate work to be done. Once the sprint is complete a working product is expected to be delivered. The objective is to define sprints that contain the work to be completed. A sprint that contains work to be completed is known as a Sprint Backlog.</p>
<p>Items in the Sprint Backlog are scheduled - resource and delivery dates have been allocated.</p>
