<section id="default-workspace">
	<h2>Default Workspace</h2>
	<p>The default workspace denotes the view that a new Portal user (one who hasn't 
	created any workspaces themselves) will see. It is sometimes better than a shared workspace, because 
	shared workspaces track changes and can be resource intensive given that <em>every></em> ticket
	is 'new' to a new user.</p>
	<p><img src="default-workspaces.png" /></p>
	<p>Select the workspace from the list and click save.</p>
	<p>When a new user visits the Gemini site, they will have this workspace's filter and column definition applied. It will run under their context, 
	so if "assigned to me" was enabled, each new user would still only see their own assigned issues.</p>
</section>

<section id="workspace-ownership">
	<h2>Workspace Ownership</h2>
	<p>This section shows all the workspaces from the selected user. All users, including disabled users, are shown here. 
	Selecting a user will show their workspaces in the table below.</p>
	<p><img src="workspace-ownership.png" /></p>
	<h3>Definitions</h3>
	<dt>Key</dt>
	<dd>The workspace code shown on the workspace button</dd>
	<dt>Title</dt>
	<dd>The workspace tooltip shown when hovering over the workspace</dd>
	<dt>From Shared</dt>
	<dd>Denotes if the workspace is from a shared source. Normally, you would not take ownership of these.</dd>
	<dt>Alerts</dt>
	<dd>Denotes if there are alerts set on the workspace</dd>
	<dt>Reports</dt>
	<dd>If there are reports scheduled, these will be listed here</dd>
	<dt>Badge</dt>
	<dd>The badge count and colour as shown on the workspace panel</dd>
	
	
	<h3>Taking Ownership</h3>
	<p>If a user has left the organization, or is no longer active in Gemini, their workspaces, especially shared ones, 
	could cause unecessary notifications, or take space in the workspace list. It is possible to change ownership of workspaces,
	to disable alerts and reports, or revoke sharing.</p>
	<p>First select the workspace to take ownership of, then select the user who will take ownership, and click the <em>Move Workspace</em> 
	button. The workspace will be moved to the new owner, and if that is the current user the workspace will appear on the left hand 
	side as normal. From there, it can be edited and managed as normal.</p>
