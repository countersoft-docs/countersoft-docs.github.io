<section id="default-workspace">
	<h2>Default Workspace</h2>
	<p>The default workspace denotes the view that a new user will see - one that has not 
	created any workspaces themselves. It is far better than a shared workspace, because 
	shared workspaces will keep track of changes and be resource intensive when every ticket
	is new to a new user.</p>
	<p><img src="default-workspaces.png" /></p>
	<p>Select the workspace from the list and click save.</p>
	<p>When a new user visits the Gemini site, they will have this workspaces filter and column definition applied. It will run under their context, 
	so if "assigned to me" was enabled, each new user would only see their own assigned issues.</p>
</section>

<section id="workspace-ownership">
	<h2>Workspace Ownership</h2>
	<p>This section shows all the workspaces from the select user. All users, including disabled users, are shown here. 
	Selecting a user will show their workspaces in the table below.</p>

	<dt>Alerts</dt>
	<dd>Denotes if there are alerts set on the workspace</dd>
	<dt>Reports</dt>
	<dd>If there are reports scheduled, these will be listed here</dd>
	<dt>Badge</dt>
	<dd>The badge count and colour as shown on the workspace panel</dd>
	
	
	<h3>Taking Ownership</h3>
	<p>If a user has left the organization, or is no longer active in Gemini, their workspaces, especially shared ones, 
	could cause unecessary notifications, or take space on the workspace bundle. It is possible to take ownership of their workspaces,
	and then disable alerts, reports or revoke sharing.</p>
	<p>First select the workspace to take ownerhsip, then select the user who will take ownership and click the <em>Move Workspace</em> 
	button. The workspace will be moved to that new owner and if that is the current user, the workspace will appear on the left hand 
	side as normal. From there, it can be edited as normal.</p>
