<h1>System Log</h1> 

<p>In addition to sending emails to the administrator email account, any system-level errors that are encountered are written to the System Log. All entries have a timestamp, verbose description of the error and, if the error was initiated from user action, the user associated with the error.</p>
<p>Gemini's System Log can be switched into diagnostic mode, in which case many timer applications as well as Rules and Actions will log their behaviour for added insight.</p>

<p>The System Log can be filtered to help you rapidly identify issues.</p>
<p>You can filter by Message Source, Date Range, and/or Keyword</p>

<p><span class="label label-important">Important</span>&nbsp;The System Log can grow quite large so we recommend you purge it monthly or quarterly.</p>
<p>To clear down the System Log use the Delete button, or if your DBA will do it as part of a regular data tuning exercise, the table to truncate is gemini_systemlog</p>
