<h1>FAQ - Gemini Fields with Special Behaviour</h1> 

<h2>Builtin Fields</h2>

<h3>Resource</h3>
<p>If Send Email Alerts and Auto-email Assigned Resource are enabled, users in the Resource field will receive automatic Resource Assignment Notifications.</p>
<img src="assigned-resource.png"/i>
<p>Resource is a field that can be intepreted by Rules and Actions <i>both</i> as a condition to test e.g "Resource = person X", or "Resource <> ''", but also in the action list where the token {resource} can be used to determine email recipients.</p>
<p>Users in the Resource field of an item can <i>always</i> see the item in Gemini, regardless of who owns it. People can't be assigned to tasks they can't see.</p>
<p>There are some additional features of the Resource field that sometimes catch people out</p>
<ul>
	<li>Whether you can assign one or more people as resources to a single work item is a per-project setting. Edit the project definition to set the option on single/multiple resources per item.</p>
	<li>Resources are not automatically Followers unless you enable the Auto-Follower Event App. Followers are people who receive email notifications on changes to items they are 'following'. Often they are external users/clients, and as such they are in the Portal User Group. Members of this group have a restricted view of items and can only see items they create or are assigned to. Just making a Portal user a follower will not make Gemini send the Portal User Follower notifications. Gemini always applies the <i>most restrictive</i> permissions, so Portal Users must be Resources to override the Portal User restrictions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporter/Reported By</h3>
<p>You might think the Creator field in Gemini holds the 'owner' of a work item. That is not the case. The owner of an item in Gemini is the Reported By user (or 'Reporter'). If no Reported By user is specified, the Creator is defaulted into that field. This subtle distinction is what allows one user to create an item in Gemini <i>on another user's behalf</i>, where the 'Reporter' is the owner and the 'Creator' is just the intermediary. Not all organizations have the scenario where one user creates items for other users, and so Reported By is often disabled on Screens, but if you did have such a scenario then you would enable the Reported By field and on data entry it will populate a list of users from which the item's true owner is selected. <i>FYI for developers - Gemini does not test the Created By field for ownership, it checks Reported By</i>.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Gemini is designed to take work from Open to Closed. Status is the only way you define a work item as closed in Gemini, the system does not use words; naming a Status 'Closed' means nothing in Gemini. If you define a Status as 'Final', then Gemini regards any item in that Status as Closed, and by default will remove it from view (though you can easily ask to see it). You can have as many Final Statuses as you need; closed is not the only status that might remove an item from regular view.</p>
<p>Status is tied to Workflow, and Workflow has security around it. Make sure you read about <a href="https://docs.countersoft.com/concept-workflow/">Workflow</a> and check the existence of status transitions and the User Groups permitted to make them if you have issues with taking an item from one Status to another.</p>
<p>Status is tied to dependencies (parent/child relationships). Gemini will not let you set a Final Status on a parent item at any level unless <i>all of its children are closed</i>. If you do not want this forced behaviour use 'Related Items' instead of Dependencies', where Gemini simply marks items as related by a reason code, and builds hyperlinks between them.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>If you cannot create a comment on an item because you do not have the permissions to do so, you cannot use the Email Reply feature, because replies are stored as comments.</p>
<p>Comments are the only individual field affected by Gemini's Visibilty settings (as opposed to visibility of the entire item). Visibility therefore exists at 2 levels - at the level of the item itself, and at the level of the Comment. When you set Visibility, you set it for ONE User Group only, and all others are excluded.</p>

<h2>Custom Fields</h2>
<p>All Custom Fields are special - they are fields you can create which Gemini will treat as if they came out of the box. The easiest way to see all of Gemini's Custom Fields is to navigate to a Project Template, and begin to create one.</p>
<img src="custom-field-types.png"/>
<p>As the image above shows, Gemini will let you create a Custom Field of every type that it possesses for its builtin fields - dates, rich text, user pickers, lists etc. The functionality behind most of these is self-evident, but let's review two that have special behaviour that goes beyond the simple description of their type.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dropdown lists can contain static data that a user can choose from, or can pull a list of data from a database table. Gemini will even create the table for you at the time the Custom Field is defined (you cannot create a table afterwards). If the data comes from a table, Gemini will let you maintain its values, but a table can pre-exist, it can be a SQL View, it can even be a SQL View into a table in a different database!</p>
	<li>Multi-select lists have the same functionality of Dropdown lists, but they let you choose <i>multiple values</i>. Both Multi-Select and Dropdown lists have 'cascading' validation functionality, which is where the selection of one field value determines the values that are available in another - like Zip Codes cascading from City, or Sub-Category cascading from Category. You can read all about this <a href="https://docs.countersoft.com/cascading-custom-field-lookups/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to more technical questions about Gemini's ability to pick data from tables or views...<p>
<ul>
	<li>Getting data from a table is a simple scenario. Views however can be far more sophisticated. A View is a SQL query that is dynamically intepreted and it can join data from multiple tables. Because Views are the implementation of a SQL Query they can do things like select distinct values in lists that contain duplicates, they can be sorted, functions can be applied to their results, like making text uppercase or lowercase, concatenating strings etc. If in your Custom Field lookup table definition you enter the name of a view, Gemini does not care - it simply executes the select query against the view instead of a table, so you can do whatever SQL Server views will allow you to do to your data. Gemini will just take whatever is passed back and put it in a list.</p>
</ul>
<h3>The problem with static lists</h3>
<p>The simplest list you can create is a static list - just type in some values. You can add to the list at any time. The problem is - you can't change a static list or delete its members without affecting the items that hold those static values.</p>
<p>Say you have a Dropdown list of locations, one of which is "Home", and you have selected Home as a value on some items. If you change Home to House, or you delete Home, Gemini will remove the value on those items. You said 'static', and static means 'non-changing'; change the item and it's no longer static. If Gemini can no longer find a Custom Field value in a supposedly static list, data integrity would be broken. You will be warned that you're about to wipe out the value on all existing records, and if you persist, Gemini will do just that.</p>
<p>The clearing of existing static values in the event of changes to the list does not happen if you use a SQL table to store the values. In that case, Gemini holds the <i>key</i> to the value not the value itself, and you can change what that key points to. Data integrity is not compromised if Gemini still points to existing data.</p>
<p>The technique for changing a static list item and updating Gemini with the change is to: a) create a new static value, b) filter the items with the old value onto the grid, c) use the ability to select and simultaneously update multiple items on the grid to change the values on the items, and then d) delete the old Custom Field value.</p>
