<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>Although all work items are prefixed by the project code this is not an intrinsic part of the key to the item. Items are uniquely numbered on a system-wide basis and because the project prefix is a display attribute items can be moved from project to project. If a support ticket with an id of HELP-901 (belongs to Project HELP) is moved to a Project DEV, it will have the key DEV-901. When moving items between projects the project prefix and data changes but the underlying numeric key remains intact thus keeping all existing linkages (attachments, comments, 3rd party connections etc.)</p>
