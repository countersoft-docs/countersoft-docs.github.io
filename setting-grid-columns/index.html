<h1>Setting Grid Columns</h1> 

<p>Everyone can set which columns they wish to see on the grid.</p>
<p>If you are the recipient of a Workspace that has been shared with Lock and Synch however (not the owner), your setting cannot be saved</p>
<p>You can drag-drop columns to arrange their order. Again however, if you cannot save the Workspace (not the owner), this ordering will not be preserved</p>
<p>Custom fields appear in bold.</p>
<p>The Project Template(s) of the projects you are viewing must have a field as Visible for you to see it in the column list</p>
