<h1>Using Reports</h1> 

<p>Reporting is located at the top of the grid for ad hoc exports and in the menu for canned reports.</p>

<p>Reports are delivered in Microsoft Excel format and users can quickly <a href="/creating-your-own-reports">create their own reports.</a></p>

<h2>Report Filter</h2>
<p>Whatever criteria is selected by the filter is used by the reports, regardless of the number of items on a page.</p>

<h2>Data Export</h2>
<p>You can export filtered data straight to Excel, HTML and CSV format, or run a report from the menu, which will also use the Workspace filter for its data selection.</p>
