<h1>Using Test Cases</h1> 

<p>A test case consists of the following sections.</p>
<p><img src="item.png" /></p>

<h2>Creating &amp; Editing</h2>
<p>Test cases can be created by clicking the plus button.</p>
<p><img src="add-test-case.png" /></p>
<p>You can also create test cases from within a test plan.</p>

<h2>Pre-conditions &amp; Expected Results</h2>
<p>A test case can be assigned pre-conditions that tell the tester what pre-requisites should be in place before testing can commence.</p>
<p>Expected results are also required in order to compare the actual results with what you expected. If the results match then the test can be marked as passed.</p>
<p><img src="pre-results.png" /></p>
<p>Both fields can contain rich text formatting and the contents can be specified during test case creation or editing.</p>

<h2>Items Tested</h2>
<p>You can find and asssociate any item with the test case. This brings traceability for co-workers who can see which of their items are covered by test cases.</p>

<h2>Test Plans</h2>
<p>Since a test case is designed to belong to test plans, all such associations are shown.</p>

<p><span class="label label-warning">Note</span>A test case can belong to multiple test plans - it's re-usable</p>

<h2>Test Steps</h2>
<p>The test steps provide a sequence of activities that must be executed in the defined order. The outcome of the activities is the actual result (which is then compared to the expected result).</p>

<p>Drag-drop to re-sequence the steps and click to edit existing steps.</p>
<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>A test case cannot run if it has no steps</p>
