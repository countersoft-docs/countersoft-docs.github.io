<h1>Cross Project Search</h1> 

<p>Select any project to include items from that project. You can pick all the projects to which you have access.</p>
<p>Projects you do not have View Project permissions for will not appear in the selection list.</p>

<p>Projects can be grouped by label. You can select the label as a shortcut to selecting the label's corresponding projects.</p>
<p><img src="category.png" /></p>
<p>Different projects can have different processes, workflows and resources. In such circumstances, the search filters will group meta-data by project to give a superset of fields.</p>
