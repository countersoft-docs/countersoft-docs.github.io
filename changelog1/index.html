<h1>Changelog - History Overview</h1> 

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Changelog helps you to view the history of changes and progress made. The Changelog helps you to understand your past development features made. The Changelog also provides a percentage of work that has been completed.</p>

<p>The selection of various Sprints/Versions helps you to drill down directly in all assets of your project.</p>

<p>To also ensure that projects or Sprints/Versions were being maintained and progressively worked on, the Changelog app displays time information to better gauge how much time was applied towards a project or Sprint/Version.</p>

Note: in order for sprint to appear in the Changelog, it must be released, and not archived.

<h2>Permission Settings</h2>
<p>With Gemini 6.1, configuring permissions for individual apps, and access to specific projects and user groups, has never been easier.</p>

</p>Simply navigate to the Apps section of your Gemini system, located at <b>Customize > Apps</b>. From here, select the Changelog app. You will then be able to configure the pertinent projects and user groups that require Changelog access.
