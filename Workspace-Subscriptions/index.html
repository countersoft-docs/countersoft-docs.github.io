<h2>Email Options</h2>
<p>You can choose to receive email alerts when items are created, updated or commented upon.</p>
<p><img src="popup.png" /></p>
<p>Note you can also determine if you would like to receive an email for each item, or one email for all items affected (batched email alerts). </p>
<p>You can also subscribe others to receive emails as well. This negates the need for co-workers to login and subscribe for themselves.</p>

<h2>Email Content</h2>
<p>Every email will detail the which fields were changed per item.</p>
