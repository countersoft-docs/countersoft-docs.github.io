<h1>Upgrading From Gemini 5 or Gemini 6</h1>
<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>&nbsp;If you are upgrading to <b>Gemini 7</b> you MUST recompile custom apps against the dlls that ship with Gemini 7. Apps built using libraries from previous versions of Gemini will NOT work with version 7.</p>
<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>&nbsp;If you are upgrading to <b>Gemini 7</b> and have built custom apps, you must remove allow partially trusted callers ([assembly: AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers]) if it is in your <b>AssemblyInfo.cs</b></p>

<p>A <a href="/using-the-zip-file">zip file</a> download is available containing both the Gemini web application and scripts needed for the upgrade process.</p>
<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>&nbsp;We strongly recommend that on-premise customers upgrade a test instance and perform full regression testing before upgrading production. 
If you are using Breeze Email Ticketing, we recommend archiving all messages in any Gemini mailboxes to another folder before upgrading.</p>

<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>&nbsp;Please do not manually execute upgrade SQL scripts - install the new release, browse to the site, and Gemini will auto upgrade the database for you.</p>

<br></br>


<h2>Step 1 - Check Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Please <a href="/pre-requisites">check</a> you have everything ready for the installation process.</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Unzip</h2>
<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>&nbsp;Right click on the file then select Properties and click Unblock.</p>
<p>Open the zip file that was downloaded, and open the folder labeled "2. Web App Manual Install". Unzip the Gemini zip file within the folder, and you should see the contents as follows:</p>
<p><img src="step2.png" /></p>
<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>&nbsp;Stop the application pool for Gemini site in IIS Manager.</p>

<h2>Step 3 - Copy Web Application</h2>
<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>&nbsp;Please remove all previous files - do not overwrite! Remember to backup your current web app directory. If you have custom templates, copy the contents of App_Data\templates and assets\images\meta folders from your backup folder to the Gemini Web Application folder.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of the Gemini Web Application folder into your current web application folder:</p>
<p><img src="step3.png" /></p>
<p><span class="label label-important">Don't forget</span>&nbsp;Copy your templates back from the backup! They are under the app_data\templates folder.</p>
<h2>Step 4 - Edit Web.config</h2>
<p>Edit the new web.config file and put in the correct SQL Server user credentials for your Gemini database:</p>
<p><img src="step4a.png" /></p>
<p>Remember to set your authentication settings:</p>
<p><img src="step4b.png" /></p>
<p>Save the web.config and your Gemini should now be upgraded to the latest release.</p>
<p>You can now navigate to the Gemini web application using your browser (e.g. http://myserver/gemini").</p>

<h2>Step 5 - Set Folder Permissions</h2>
<p>For complete administrative control, Gemini requires write access to the following <b>THREE FOLDERS</b> that are located where you installed Gemini:</p>
<p><img src="step5.png" /></p>
<ul>
    <li>Right click <code>App_Code</code> folder, select Security tab, allocate Modify/Full Control permissions to the EVERYONE group</li>
    <li>Right click <code>App_Data</code> folder, select Security tab, allocate Modify/Full Control permissions to the EVERYONE group</li>
    <li>Right click <code>Assets</code> folder, select Security tab, allocate Modify/Full Control permissions to the EVERYONE group</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 6 - Using SQL Upgrade Scripts</h2>

<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>&nbsp;If you are upgrading Gemini 6, DO NOT manually execute upgrade SQL scripts - install the new release, browse to the site, and Gemini will auto upgrade for you. If the SQL user does not have the appropriate user permissions to upgrade Gemini automatically, you will need to grant the appropriate permissions.</p>
<br></br>

<p>If you are upgrading Gemini 5 and the SQL user does not have the appropriate user permissions to upgrade Gemini automatically, you must execute the scripts manually. To do so:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Locate your Gemini installation folder.</li>
	<li>Open the folder named "SQL".</li>
	<li>Open and run all SQL scripts, that correlate to your current Gemini version, against your existing database.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="label label-important">For Example</span>&nbsp;If your current Gemini version is 5.1.2, you will need to run the following upgrade scripts: 5.1.3, 5.1.5, 5.1.6, etc. After running the SQL scripts, start the application pool for Gemini site in IIS Manager.</p>
