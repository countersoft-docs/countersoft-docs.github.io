	<h2>Default Workspace</h2>
	<p>The default workspace denotes the view that a new user will see - one that has not 
	created any workspaces themselves. It is far better than a shared workspace, because 
	shared workspaces will keep track of changes and be resource intensive when every ticket
	is new to a new user.</p>
	<p><img src="defaultworkspace.png" /></p>
	<p>Select the workspace from the list and click save.</p>
	<p>When a new user visits the Gemini site, they will have this workspaces filter and column definition applied. It will run under their context, 
	so if "assigned to me" was enabled, each new user would only see their own assigned issues.</p>

<p>In addition to sending emails to the administrator email account, any system-level errors that are encountered are written to the System Log. All entries have a timestamp, verbose description of the error and, if the error was initiated from user action, the user associated with the error.</p>
