<h1>Installation FAQ</h1>

<h3>Do I have to download and install Gemini?</h3>
<p>No. You can use our cloud service, where we host your instance. You pay a monthly fee and can cancel at any time, or a discounted annual fee, but you cannot then cancel until the end of the term. Please get in touch with sales@countersoft.com for details on annual discounts, as volume discounts apply.</p>

<h3>Does Gemini require Microsoft.NET?</h3>
<p>Please follow the prerequisites link below for the version of Microsoft .Net that is required.</p>

<h3>Using IIS 6</h3>
<p>IIS 7 or above is strongly recommended. The following steps will need to be followed if you are installing Gemini on a server that is running IIS 6.</p>

<ol>
    <li> Right-click on the website or application in IIS and select Properties. </li>
    <li>Using the Virtual Directory tab (Home Directory for some versions of IIS) click on the configuration button at the bottom of the menu.</li>
    <li>From the Mappings tab, select the .aspx extension and click 'edit'.</li>
    <li>Copy the full executable path (should be the aspnet_isapi.dll).</li>
    <li>Go back to the Mappings tab and select .mvc and click edit (or add if it does not exist)</li>
    <li>Paste the path to the aspnet_isapi.dll in the window. Verbs should be at least 'get, post, head, debug', and make sure 'verify that file exists' is unchecked and click OK.</li>
    <li>Go back to the mapping screen and 'Insert a Wildcard Application Map' (.*), Paste the aspnet_isapi.dll in the same path and uncheck 'verify that file exists'. Once done, click OK.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Gemini & Windows Authentication</h3>
<p>Gemini does not need Azure AD for Windows Authentication. It has an Azure AD integration to add and delete users, but Gemini authenticates through IIS with Windows, not AD.</p>
<p>For deployment scenarios where Windows Authentication is required, ensure the IIS Application Pool assigned to the Gemini instance is using the <code>Network Service</code> account. For further information regarding the configuration of Gemini to use Windows Authentication, please <a href="https://github.com/countersoft/Azure">click here</a>.</p>
