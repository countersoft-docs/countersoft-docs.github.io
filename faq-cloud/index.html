<h1>Gemini Cloud FAQ</h1> 

<h3>How can I access my database?</h3>
<p>You can only access your database through the Gemini UI or with the <a href="https://docs.countersoft.com/rest-api/">REST API</a>.

<h3>Can I use Windows Authentication or AD in your hosted environment?</h3>
<p>No. You can only use Forms (username/password) Authentication. With Gemini 7.4 and above, you can also implement 2-factor Authentication using modern Authenticator Apps.</p>

<h3>Can I migrate my on-premise instance into your cloud?</h3>
<p>Yes you can. Please read the <a href="https://docs.countersoft.com/faq-onpremise-to-ondemand/">on-premise to on-demand migration</a> document.</p>

<h3>Can I migrate my hosted instance to my servers/cloud provider's service?</h3>
<p>Yes you can. Please read the <a href="https://docs.countersoft.com/faq-ondemand-to-onpremise/">on-demand to on-premise migration</a> document.</p>

<h3>Can I run Gemini on Azure or AWS?</h3>
<p>Yes you can, and our customers do. Gemini is a standard .Net MVC application deployed by IIS and utilising a SQL Server backend. It will run on anything that supports that tech stack.</p>

<h3>I need to know where your cloud servers are physically located</h3>
<p>Our servers are co-located with <a href="https://www.rapidswitch.com/">Rapidswitch</a> in the UK.</p>

<h3>Can I trial your on-demand service? If I decide Gemini is for us, can I keep my on-demand site, or alternatively, migrate it on-premise?</h3>
<p>The answer to all three questions is yes. Contact <a href=mailto:sales@countersoft.com>Sales@Countersoft.com</a> to request a trial or to plan a migration to or from our cloud.</p>

<h3>What are the terms of use and pricing?</h3>
<p>Terms of user are covered in our <a href=https://countersoft.com/eula.pdf>EULA</a>. Pricing and FAQs around pricing are available on <a href="https://www.countersoft.com/pricing/cloud/">the pricing page</a> of our website.</p>
