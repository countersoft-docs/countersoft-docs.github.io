<h1>The Daily Scrum</h1> 
<p>Agile and Scrum working usually means running a Daily Scrum to answer three key questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What did we do yesterday?</li>
	<li>What are we doing today?</li>
	<li>Are there any blocking issues or show-stoppers?</li>
</ul>

<p>The grid can be used to filter and view items for any Sprint and/or Backlog.</p>

<p>You can share workspaces that define your view of the world with co-workers, so they see what you see.</p>

<p>The Burndown chart tracks how many items remain open as you approach the delivery date for the sprint. The timeline is represented along the X axis.</p>

<p>The objective is to have no open items as you hit the delivery date.</p>
<p>The solid black line represents the ideal line that shows the target you should hit at various time intervals.</p>

<p>The Burnup chart tracks how many items are closed as you approach the delivery date for the sprint.</p>
