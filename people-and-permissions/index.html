<h1>People and Permissions</h1> 

<p>User Security Groups let you control access to projects. Permission Sets let you control the features, functions and visibility of data within your projects. This commination is how you control who can do what on which project. <a href="/active-directory-groups">Active Directory Integration</a> and <a href="/windows-authentication">Windows Authentication</a> give you additional controls over people and permissions.</p>
