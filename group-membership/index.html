<h1>Group Membership</h1> 

<p>If you click on the Members link on the Group screen you will be able to define which projects the Group has access to and which users belong to the Group.</p>

<h3>Project vs Global </h3>

<p>Users that are added to the All Projects group automatically have access to every project and therefore are Global Users.</p> 

<p><img src="all-projects.png" /></p>

<p>To define project-specific access click on the hyperlink on the right of the project(s) and select the users from the multi-select drop-down list. Global Users who are members of the All Projects group will not be available to select for Project Groups since by definition they have access to every project.</p>

<p>Whenever you change the selection list of users in a group you need to click on the tick to confirm (or the cross to cancel) your changes.</p>
