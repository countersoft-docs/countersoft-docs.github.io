<h1>Interaction Groups</h1> 

<p>Workspaces allow users to <a href="/sharing-workspaces">share views and data</a>. To determine which groups can share workspaces, click on the Edit icon on the right of the screen after the Group has been created. You will then see a multi-select drop-down for all of the User Groups in the system that members of the Project Group you have just created/edited can share with.</p>

<p>The interaction groups will show up when you change a workspace and select 'Share'.</p>
