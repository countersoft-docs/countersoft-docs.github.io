<h1>User Management</h1> 

<p>Add, find, delete, edit new users within Gemini.</p>
<p><img src="grid.png" /></p>

<p>Adding a new user requires basic information for the new user.</p>
<p><img src="add-user.png" /></p>

<p>You cannot delete a user record that is associated with data in your Gemini instance and you will receive a warning to that effect if you try to do so. In the event that a user record that is associated with data is no longer required, you must disable the user.</p>

<p><span class="label label-important">Note</span>For information on managing users through Active Directory see <a href="/active-directory-groups">Active Directory Groups</a></p>

<h2>User Security Audit</h2> 

<p>You can now view individual user permissions across all projects to see which actions they can perform.</p>
