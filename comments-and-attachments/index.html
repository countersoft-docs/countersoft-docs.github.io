<p>If you have enabled Visibility on your Project Termplate, you can control the visibility of an individual comment to ensure that only certain user groups can see it.</p>
<p><span class="label label-important">Important</span>&nbsp;Gemini will not let one user amend another user's comments. You can delete comments if you have the permission to do so.</p>

<p>Every item can also have unlimited file attachments.</p>
